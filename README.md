# Projects to learn about Machine Learning
Personal learning projects and it's results for learning some basics of machine learning.

These Projects were build in Jupyter Notebooks for documentation and visualisition purposes.

## About the Projects

This repository contains 5 different Notebooks, this is their content:

1. bike_demand_regression: A model trained based on a dataset about number of rented bikes based on various factors. The model is trained to predict bike demand using linear regression.

2. breastcancer-SVM: A model trained to determine wether breastcancer is malignant or benign in a specific case using support vector models.

3. penguins_cluster: A model trained to determine to which of 3 species a penguin belongs. Trained using cluster.

4. DogsvCats_neural(-Copy1): A model trained to differantiate wether the picture shows a dog or a cat using a neural network. DogsvCats_neural uses images scaled to 175x175, while DogsvCats_neural-Copy1 uses the same images scaled to 100x100 to test if outcome changes.




## Running the Projects

The projects were created with anaconda version 2022.10. To open the notebooks, run anaconda and the open the notebooks.
